LED control
======

LED controlling application for AdaFruit NeoPixels and AdaFruit Trinket.

Usage
=====

- Download and unpack latest release package with binaries into empty directory.
- Before doing anything serious, you'll have to burn trinket_serial.ino firmware into AdaFruit Trinket 5V microcontroller. It must be the one with 5V voltage for 16MHz processing speed which is required for USB port serial communication.
- The next step consists of Win32 libusb driver installation. However, this step is not necessary for UNIX-based systems.
- After these steps you can finally start the server and client side scripts

== Client side
```
luajit.exe main.lua
```
or a version without console window
```
client.exe
```

== Server side
```
luajit.exe main.lua
```
or a version without console window
```
server.exe
```

== Adafruit Trinket microcontroller
This USB device can be identified with following IDs:
